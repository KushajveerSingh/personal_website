Stable v/s Unstable sorting algorithm

- Stable - order of the elements is preserved
- Unstable - order of the elements is not preserved.
- For example, when sorting the array \[4, 1(a), 3, 1(b)], the order of the 1's i.e. a and b is preserved in stable sorting algorithms.

## Insertion Sort

- Time = `O(N^2)`, Space = `O(1)`, Stable
- Split the array into sorted (left) and unsorted (right) array.
- Takes the maximum time if elements are sorted in reverse order.
- _Insertion_ sort is used when the size of the array is small and the array is almost sorted. Like you can first start with _QuickSort_, and when the subarray size get's smaller than a threshold use _Insertion_ sort.

Example of the working

- \[7, 8, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3] - (7) is already sorted
- \[7, 8, 5, 2, 4, 6, 3]
- \[5, 7, 8, 2, 4, 6, 3]

```python showLineNumbers
def insertion_sort(x):
    if len(x) == 0:
        return x

    for i in range(1, len(x)):
        # We want to place the current element "x[i]" in the correct position
        # in the left subarry
        key = x[i]

        # Swap the elements till you find the correct position to place "key"
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and x[j] > key:
            x[j+1] = x[j]
            j = j - 1
        x[j+1] = key

    return x
```
